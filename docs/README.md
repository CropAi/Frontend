# FRONTEND FOR CROP ANALYZER APP :fallen_leaf:
 
## INTRODUCTION

[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/GSSOC-20-orange?style=for-the-badge">](https://www.gssoc.tech/)<br />
This is a crop advisory app for farmers and gardeners. It can diagnose pest damage, plant disease and nutrient deficiencies that are affecting crops and can offer corresponding treatment measures.

## VISION

The intention of the project is to familiarise the student with open source development in the field of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Android Development. It will be done by making a real-life application that can be used by the consumers. Our aim is to make an end to end crop advisory app for farmers and gardeners. It can diagnose pest damage, plant disease and nutrient deficiencies that are affecting crops and can offer corresponding treatment measures.

## WORKING

This application takes an image of the leaf or crop as input and shows the results. It diagnoses the plant disease, pest damage, nutrient deficiencies and other factors affecting the growth of the crop and offers corresponding treatment measures to cure it. The result will be mainly presented in three categories, which are symptoms, treatments, and recommended products.

## Guide to using the Web Application


Now comes the most exciting part of the project. Understanding and making use of the actual Web Application. So let's get started. ü•≥ üëΩ

1. Start off by visiting the hosted application using this [CropAI Analyzer](https://cropai.netlify.app/) üëª

2. Open the application on your personal browser and you should have it ready to use.

3. As every typical Web Application, we made sure you get the most exciting User Experience working on the application ......üßì

SPOILER ALERT: Be ready to have your mind blown...üòúüòè

### HOME PAGE

The home provides you with a brief description about who we are, what we do, and why we made the application. 

Click on the `Analyze` button to be able to interact with the web application.

</p>

### ANALYZE PAGE

Just the page you need to use the most exciting stuff and analyze crop diseases.

Use the `Upload Image` button to upload your desired image to analyze and it should have a preview ready for you to see, just as a confirmation.

Just in case you selected the incorrect image  ( yes it happens with us as well üò¥)  you can always use the `Change Image` button to change the image.

It should look something like this:

</p>


Hit the `Submit` Button and relax and let our application to the rest of the work for you! üòá üòâ


### RESULT PAGE

It's finally that time, as everything we did was to lead us to this moment. 
It should have the results right infront of you (I know it takes 30 seconds), but as you know,***"GOOD THINGS IN LIFE TAKES TIME"***.
<p align="center">

</p>

I'm pretty sure you want to go again on this since it's as exciting as it gets. 

You may use the `ANALYZE ANOTHER CROP` Crop at the bottom of the page.
